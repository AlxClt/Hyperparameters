# Automate Hyperparameter tuning

In this project I wanted to explore methods for automate hyperparameter tuning, particularly in the context of deep learning, and share my results / thoughts / doubts

As of today, I have written [a short introduction to bayesian hyperparameter tuning with hyperopt](https://github.com/AlxClt/Hyperparameters/blob/master/Introduction%20to%20bayesian%20hyperparameters%20optimization.ipynb) and I have made a first attempt in applying these methods to deep learning [with the MNIST dataset](https://github.com/AlxClt/Hyperparameters/blob/master/MNIST_bayes_opt.ipynb).

Work is still in progress, feel free to reach out if you have remarks and questions!
